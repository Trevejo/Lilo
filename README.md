# RPG-Battle
A RPG battle simulation game made with HTML, JavaScript and CSS using jQuery and Bootstrap.

# How to play:
The game uses probability to simulate battles. Each character has a base health and damage points.
- Health - Damage you can receive before die;
- Damage - Health that your enemy will lost if you hit an attack;

You start with 1 evolution point, which can be used to add 5 health or damage points to a character. 
You earn an evolution point every time you defeat 3 enemies of an enemy type: Orcs, Zombies or Demons.

To start a battle, first you must select your enemy and click "start battle". Then you can select one of the characters available: Warrior, Archer and Mage.

Every time you click the attack button your character has a chance to hit the enemy, and the enemy has a chance to hit your character. 
The result of the attack will be displayed below the character's attributes.

After you defeat your enemies, you can withdraw your evolution points by clicking "withdraw points".

Will you be able to defeat the demons? Have fun :)
